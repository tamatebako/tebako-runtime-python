# machine-readable unit; the registry is a spec 04 §2 MIRROR of
# resolution fields, derived — never hand-authored). Ported from
# tebako-runtime-openjdk's tools/registry_update.rb (itself
# tebako-runtime-ruby#161's), keeping the RUBY factory's composite
# version keys:
#
# One payload entry (`python`, kind: runtime, engine: python — the
# spec 04 §2 MINOR 1 edge-discovery key, always rendered). One version
# line per python the release built, keyed `<python>-<tebako>` composite
# (the collision-free key: one python version ships on several tebako
# lines and every line stays addressable; a variant-suffixed python like
# 3.13.15-jit keeps its suffix inside the composite, and the resolver's
# plain-wins rule — spec 05 §5 — still ranks the plain line above it).
# Per-triplet platform rows mirror the shard's ENV IMAGE artifact +
# sha256 (the registry names the image; the wrapper exe is pinned per
# tebako product line); the version's release ref points at the release
# the shards came from. The merge is additive and write-once-friendly:
# existing versions keep their rows (new shards win per triplet),
# `status: withdrawn` marks (the only sanctioned hand-edit — spec 04
# §2) survive every render, and `default:` tracks the newest
# non-withdrawn version.
#
# The workflow calls this in the release job and lands the result by bot
# PR against main — git arbitrates, never a force-push.
